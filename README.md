mailchute
=========

Mailchute is a combination of popular front-end development tools with a few tweaks to help designers build HTML emails quickly.

It uses:

- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to stream changes to data, templates, and stylesheets
- JSON objects to store content and copy
- [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) to make building templates and reusable components easy
- [SCSS](https://github.com/sass/sass) to style it all up (including a few bits and pieces from [BassCSS](https://github.com/basscss/basscss))
- [BrowserSync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync) to preview how your email will look
- [Premailer](https://github.com/premailer/premailer) to inline your styles when you're ready to send it.
